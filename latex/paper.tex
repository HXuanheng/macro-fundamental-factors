\abstract{This sample is a guideline for preparing technical papers using \LaTeX\
for manuscript submission. It contains the documentation for your \LaTeX\
Class file, which implements the layout for your manuscript for all Journals of OUP.
This sample article uses a class file named \texttt{ouparticle.cls} that all authors
need to use for their manuscript preparation. It is similar in use to the \texttt{article}
class file of \LaTeX, but has some extra fields in the preamble and some extended commands for
other parts of the article.}
